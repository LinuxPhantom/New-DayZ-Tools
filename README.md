### What's Inside This Toolkit? üì¶
- **Obfuscation Tools**: We offer three distinct obfuscators (`DeMikeroObfuscator.exe`, `JAPM_Windows_x86_64.exe`, `RePBO_.exe`) along with some others designed to reverse engineer PBO files.
- **P3D Analysis**: Curious about the intricacies of P3D files? Tools like `D3P3D-main` and `P3DAnalyzer` will help you dig deep into them.
- **Key Management**: The `bisign2bikey` utility is your friend when it comes to generating BIKEY files from BISIGN files, ensuring secure and authenticated mod distribution.

## Most Of This Is Used By DRAG AND DROPPING The PBO Onto The Exe!

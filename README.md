## 📄 License

I Couldn't Care Less Even If You Stuff It Up Your Ass - ICCLEIYSIUYA
====================================================================

Copying and distributing this license is permitted and encouraged. This
license is subject to the terms inside itself so anybody is free to do 
whatever he/she wishes with the license.

Preamble
========

Most computer software license models have been written to prevent the
free distribution and/or modification of software. There are, however,
more liberal license models like GPL but even GPL sets some restrictions,
as most developers know. ICCLEIYSIUYA is a model that removes all rights
and responsibilities of the original writer and sets absolutely no
restrictions as to what the software can be done with.

Terms for copying, distribution and modifications
=================================================

This License is applicable with any Software Product or any Work
(hereafter referred to as "Product") that contains a written statement
from the Author of the Product implying that the distribution of the
Product is subject to ICCLEIYSIUYA.

1. Anybody can do anything with the Product. The Product can be copied,
   distributed and modified freely. The Author neither makes claims or has
   any responsibilities regarding the Product. A real-life example: it is
   completely legal to copy a software Product to a USB memory stick and 
   stuff the stick up one's ass or, if preferred, into a living or dead 
   donkey*. The Author may and very probably will lose all interest in the 
   afterlife of the Product and has no responsibility whatsoever as to what
   will happen with the Product after its release. Neither has the Author 
   any obligation to comment on the Product, its use, further development or
   anything else, not even when asked politely or impolitely.

*("donkey" is a synonym for "ass").
